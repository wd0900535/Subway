<p>This is our group project for CIS171</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>We were given the problem to create an Subway Ordering System using Java and JavaFX. We were required to include these fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Size of sandwich</li>
  <li>Type of bread</li>
  <li>Type of meat</li>
  <li>Type of cheese</li>
  <li>Up to three veggies</li>
  <li>Type of Sauce</li>
  <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>on the ordering system. We also were required to have an "active" sandwich summary which would show what the customers has selected. The summary was required to update by each field. We were told to make it look professional.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>We decided to keep all the code in the main and work top-down. We split the project up into three parts, GUI V1, GUIV2, and backend components/functions.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>We made sure that all the menu buttons, dropdowns, etc all worked and the changes showed on the sandwich summary. We made sure the order button was active until the user selected at least the size, bread, and meat. Everything else is optional.</p>
